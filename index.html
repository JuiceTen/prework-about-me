      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I worked with the Department of Sanitation NY for the past 3 years working to get composting/organics pickup for all NYC neighborhoods. I studied Environmental Studies in Hunter College for my BA and I am currently interested in coding to help broaded my skill sets.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Brooklyn, NY and currently still reside there.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am an avid snowboarder and currently trying to become a better rock climber. I dabbled in the arts when I was younger and would still like to continue again.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Currently I am unsure, but I would love to work with animals or environmental conservancies either physically or digitally.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Brooklyn</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As the market for tech skills become more abundant I feel it is necessary to understand and become proficient in coding and coding language to help myself find new ways to approach environmental conservation.</p>
